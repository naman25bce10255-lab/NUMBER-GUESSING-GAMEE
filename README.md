# NUMBER-GUESSING-GAMEE
The number guessing game is a step-by-step interactive game with defined rules and simple logic, often used in computer science education to teach loops, conditions, and random number generation.
The computer randomly selects a number within a set range.
The player enters a guess for the secret number.
The program checks if the guess matches the random number.
If the guess is too low, the program informs the player the number is higher.
If the guess is too high, the program informs the player the number is lower.
The player continues guessing based on the feedback.
The attempts are counted until the player guesses correctly or reaches the maximum allowed tries.
The game ends and the correct number is revealed if not guessed within the allotted attempts.
